# Graphical user interface (first year project at ENSIMAG)

The objective of this project is to realize a software library that facilitates the programming of graphical user interfaces.
Using this library, a programmer will be able to easily create a graphical interface composed of windows and interactors such as buttons, input fields or mini-games.
The realization of this software library (set of functions in C language) is intended for programmers and not for users.
We are given functions to :
- access to the pixels of the screen ;
- draw text ;
- draw graphic primitives (drawing lines, polygons) ;
- receive user actions on the keyboard and mouse (keystroke events, mouse movement, etc.).

This project was developed in groups of 4 during more than a month. We had to realize the following algorithms :
- configuration and drawing of the interactors (buttons, windows ...) ;
- management of the geometry (position, size) of the interactors on the screen, in particular when changing the size of the window ;
- management of user events (execution of functions in reaction to user actions).

# Code
The source code of the final project is not publicly available because this project will be proposed again next year at ENSIMAG.

Technologies: C, CMake, Git, SDL
